## 📈 Monitoring

### Health Check
Visit `/health` endpoint to verify the system is running:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
}
```

### Live Statistics
The main page now shows real-time statistics that update automatically via WebSocket.

### Admin Dashboard
Access detailed analytics and system monitoring at `/admin-dashboard`.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Render.com logs for specific errors
2. Verify all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
3. Ensure `Procfile` is correct: `web: python app.py`
4. Check `runtime.txt` specifies Python version

### Common issues:
